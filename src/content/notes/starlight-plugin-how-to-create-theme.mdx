Starlight plugins offer an easy-to-share and reusable way to customize the look and feel of Starlight, the fully-featured documentation theme built on top of the Astro framework.
A Starlight plugin provides all the necessary tools to create a Starlight theme, from [adding custom CSS](/notes/starlight-plugin-add-custom-css) to [overriding Starlight components](/notes/starlight-plugin-override-starlight-component).

This guide will walk you through the process of creating a Starlight theme using [`generator-starlight-plugin`](https://github.com/HiDeoo/generator-starlight-plugin), a Yeoman generator to help create Starlight plugins and themes.

## Create a Starlight theme

The `generator-starlight-plugin` Yeoman generator is an opinionated but still lightweight Yeoman generator to help create Starlight plugins and themes:

- **Opinionated**: [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) are required to generate a [monorepo](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) containing a Starlight plugin package and a Starlight documentation project acting at the same time as a playground to test the plugin. The plugin is expected to be written in TypeScript, hosted on GitHub, and licensed under the MIT license.
- **Lightweight**: Formatting, linting, testing, bundling, publishing, and deploying the documentation, which are all optional for a Starlight plugin, are not enforced by the generator. You are free to add them to the project as you see fit using the tools and services you prefer.

To run the generator, run the following command in the terminal from the directory where you want to work on the theme:

```bash title="Terminal"
npx -p yo -p @hideoo/generator-starlight-plugin -- yo @hideoo/starlight-plugin
```

A series of prompts will guide you through the process of creating a Starlight theme.

```ansi title="Terminal"

```

After answering the prompts, the generator will scaffold a new monorepo containing a Starlight plugin package and a Starlight documentation project acting as a playground to test the theme.

## Start the development

The generated project uses a monorepo structure with different pnpm workspaces:

- `docs/`: A Starlight documentation project to document the theme that also acts as a playground.
- `packages/theme-name/`: A package containing the Starlight plugin and theme.

To start developing the Starlight theme, edit the `packages/theme-name/styles.css` file which will be the theme CSS file automatically added to Starlight by the plugin.

To test the theme, run the following command from the `docs/` directory:

```bash title="Terminal"
pnpm dev
```

import Outro from './shared/_starlight-plugins-by-example-outro.astro'

<Outro />
