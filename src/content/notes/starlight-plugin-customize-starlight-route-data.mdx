Starlight plugins offer an easy-to-share and reusable way to customize and extend Starlight, the fully-featured documentation theme built on top of the Astro framework.

This guide will walk you through the process of customizing Starlight's [route data](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/route-data/) in a Starlight plugin, which is an object containing all the information used to render a page.

## Customize route data

To [customize](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/route-data/#how-to-customize-route-data) route data, route data middlewares can be used to modify the route data object before it is used to render a page.
A [`routeMiddleware`](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/configuration/#routemiddleware) configuration option is available to add route data middlewares to a Starlight project by referencing their paths.
Starlight plugins can [read and update](/notes/starlight-plugin-read-and-update-starlight-configuration) this configuration option to add their own route data middlewares to customize Starlight's route data.

This option supports local files relative to the root of the project, e.g. `'./src/routeData.ts'` which is an approach that would not work in a Starlight plugin, as the route data middlewares would be part of the plugin package and not the Starlight project.
To support this use case, Starlight plugins can [export](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#package-entry-points) a route data middleware from the plugin package, and reference the associated identifier in the `routeMiddleware` option.

### Export a route data middleware

To export a route data middleware file from a Starlight plugin, you can add a new entry in the [`exports`](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#exports) field of the plugin's `package.json` file.

The following example adds a new entry point name `./middleware` that points to a `middleware.ts` file in the plugin's root directory:

```diff lang=json title="package.json" /"starlight-plugin-example"/
{
  "name": "starlight-plugin-example",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "license": "MIT",
  "type": "module",
  "exports": {
-    ".": "./plugin.ts"
+    ".": "./plugin.ts",
+    "./middleware": "./middleware.ts"
  },
  "peerDependencies": {
    "@astrojs/starlight": ">=0.34"
  }
}
```

### Add the route data middleware to the Starlight configuration

To reference the previously exported route data middleware file in the Starlight configuration, the `starlight-plugin-example/middleware` identifier can be used in the [`routeMiddleware`](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/configuration/#routemiddleware) option of the Starlight configuration.

To update the user-supplied Starlight configuration in a Starlight plugin, you can use the [`addRouteMiddleware()`](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/plugins/#addroutemiddleware) function provided in the [`config:setup`](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/plugins/#configsetup) Starlight plugin configuration setup function.

This function takes an object with an `entrypoint` property that references the route data middleware file to add as its first argument.

The following example updates the `routeMiddleware` option in the user-supplied Starlight configuration to add the route data middleware exported from the `starlight-plugin-example` package:

```ts / (addRouteMiddleware) /  {10-12}
// plugin.ts
import type { StarlightPlugin } from '@astrojs/starlight/types'

export default function starlightPluginExample(): StarlightPlugin {
  return {
    name: 'starlight-plugin-example',
    hooks: {
      'config:setup'({ addRouteMiddleware }) {
        // Add plugin-specific route data middleware.
        addRouteMiddleware({
          entrypoint: 'starlight-plugin-example/middleware',
        })
      },
    },
  }
}
```

After creating the `middleware.ts` file in the plugin's root directory, you can add the [custom route data middleware logic](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/route-data/#how-to-customize-route-data) to it.
