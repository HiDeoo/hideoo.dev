Starlight plugins offer an easy-to-share and reusable way to customize and extend [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/), the fully-featured documentation theme built on top of the Astro framework.

This guide will walk you through the process of customizing Starlight's [route data](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/route-data/) in a Starlight plugin, which is an object containing all the information used to render a page.

## Customize route data

To [customize](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/route-data/#how-to-customize-route-data) route data, route data middlewares can be used to modify the route data object before it is used to render a page.
Starlight plugins can add route data middlewares by using the [`addRouteMiddleware()`](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/plugins/#addroutemiddleware) and providing the module specifier of a route data middleware to it.

### Export a route data middleware

To export a route data middleware file from a Starlight plugin, you can add a new entry in the [`exports`](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#exports) field of the plugin's `package.json` file.

The following example adds a new entry point name `./middleware` that points to a `middleware.ts` file in the plugin's root directory:

```diff lang=json title="package.json" /"starlight-plugin-example"/
{
  "name": "starlight-plugin-example",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "license": "MIT",
  "type": "module",
  "exports": {
-    ".": "./plugin.ts"
+    ".": "./plugin.ts",
+    "./middleware": "./middleware.ts"
  },
  "peerDependencies": {
    "@astrojs/starlight": ">=0.34"
  }
}
```

### Add the route data middleware to the Starlight configuration

To reference the previously exported route data middleware file in the Starlight configuration, you can use the [`addRouteMiddleware()`](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/plugins/#addroutemiddleware) function provided in the [`config:setup`](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/plugins/#configsetup) Starlight plugin configuration setup function.

This function takes an object with an `entrypoint` property that references the route data middleware file to add as its first argument.

The following example uses the `addRouteMiddleware()` function to add a route data middleware that is exported from the `starlight-plugin-example` package:

```ts / (addRouteMiddleware) /  {10-12}
// plugin.ts
import type { StarlightPlugin } from '@astrojs/starlight/types'

export default function starlightPluginExample(): StarlightPlugin {
  return {
    name: 'starlight-plugin-example',
    hooks: {
      'config:setup'({ addRouteMiddleware }) {
        // Add plugin-specific route data middleware.
        addRouteMiddleware({
          entrypoint: 'starlight-plugin-example/middleware',
        })
      },
    },
  }
}
```

After creating the `middleware.ts` file in the plugin's root directory, you can add the [custom route data middleware logic](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/route-data/#how-to-customize-route-data) to it.
