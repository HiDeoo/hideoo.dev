Starlight plugins offer an easy-to-share and reusable way to customize and extend Starlight, the fully-featured documentation theme built on top of the Astro framework.

This guide will walk you through the process of exposing Astro components in a Starlight plugin, allowing users to use them in their Starlight projects.

import Prerequisites from './shared/_starlight-plugins-by-example-prerequisites.astro'

<Prerequisites />

## Export an Astro component

To export an Astro component from a Starlight plugin, you can add a new entry in the [`exports`](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#exports) field of the plugin's `package.json` file.

The following example adds a new entry point name `./PluginComponent.astro` that points to a `PluginComponent.astro` file in the plugin's root directory:

```diff lang=json title="package.json" /"starlight-plugin-example"/
{
  "name": "starlight-plugin-example",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "license": "MIT",
  "type": "module",
  "exports": {
-    ".": "./plugin.ts"
+    ".": "./plugin.ts",
+    "./PluginComponent.astro": "./PluginComponent.astro"
  },
  "peerDependencies": {
    "@astrojs/starlight": ">=0.34"
  }
}
```

## Use the Astro component in a Starlight project

Once the Astro component is exported from the Starlight plugin, it can be used in a Starlight project by importing it from the plugin package and using its associated identifier.

The following example uses the `<PluginComponent/>` component exported from the `starlight-plugin-example` package in an MDX content page from a Starlight project:

```mdx {8,10}
---
# src/content/docs/example.mdx
title: My page title
---

My page content.

import PluginComponent from 'starlight-plugin-example/PluginComponent.astro'

<PluginComponent />
```

import Outro from './shared/_starlight-plugins-by-example-outro.astro'

<Outro />
