[Expressive Code](https://expressive-code.com/) is an amazing library for creating beautiful and accessible code blocks with ease.
It provides a lot of features out-of-the-box, such as syntax highlighting, editor and terminal frames, text and line markers, a code component, and a lot more.

Expressive Code also provides integrations with many popular frameworks such as [Astro](https://astro.build/) or [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), making it easy to use it in your projects.
[Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/), the fully-featured documentation theme built on top of the Astro framework, also uses Expressive Code to render code blocks by default.

You can learn more about Expressive Code in the [official documentation](https://expressive-code.com/).

## Expressive Code plugins

Expressive Code process code blocks using plugins and supports the creation of [custom plugins](https://expressive-code.com/guides/developing-plugins/) to extend its capabilities.
Plugins can add new features or markup around various parts of a code block, or even a range of characters.

This guide will walk you through creating a simple Expressive Code plugin to report incorrect code blocks.
To do so, the plugin will add a link after each code block pointing to a pre-filled issue on GitHub including the code block content.

## Prerequisites

You will need to have an existing project using Expressive Code.
You can check the Expressive Code [installation guide](https://expressive-code.com/installation/) to get started.

## Plugin architecture

An Expressive Code plugin can be created using the `definePlugin()` helper provided by the library.
This function takes as an argument a single configuration object that will define the plugin behavior.

```js {6-10}
// src/ec-report-plugin.mjs
import { definePlugin } from '@expressive-code/core'

export function reportCodeBlockPlugin() {
  return definePlugin({
    name: 'Report',
    hooks: {
      // Hooks that can attach custom behavior to various steps of a code
      // block lifecycle.
    },
  })
}
```

The [`hooks`](https://expressive-code.com/reference/plugin-hooks/) property of the configuration object contains the different events the plugin can listen to to attach custom behavior for every step of a code block lifecycle.

To use a plugin, add it to the [`plugins`](https://expressive-code.com/reference/configuration/#plugins) array in the Expressive Code configuration object.
The following example shows how to add the custom plugin created above in the Expressive Code configuration inside an Astro project.

```js ins={4} ins={9-12}
// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
import astroExpressiveCode from 'astro-expressive-code'
import { reportCodeBlockPlugin } from './src/ec-report-plugin.mjs'

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    astroExpressiveCode({
      plugins: [
        // Add the report plugin to the Expressive Code configuration.
        reportCodeBlockPlugin(),
      ],
    }),
  ],
})
```

## Add a new element after code blocks

To add a new element after each code block, the [`postprocessRenderedBlock`](https://expressive-code.com/reference/plugin-hooks/#postprocessrenderedblock) hook can be used.
This hook let you modify the rendered code block after it has been processed by Expressive Code using the [`renderData`](https://expressive-code.com/reference/plugin-hooks/#renderdata) object.

This hook gives us access to the code block using a [Hypertext Abstract Syntax Tree](https://github.com/syntax-tree/hast) (HAST) representation.
This tree can be modified to customize a code block, add new elements, or update existing ones.

To add a new element after each code block, a custom plugin can wrap the rendered code block in a new element and add the desired content after it.
The [`h()`](https://github.com/syntax-tree/hastscript#hselector-properties-children) helper function is provided to create new HAST nodes.

```js {9-17}
// src/ec-report-plugin.mjs
import { definePlugin } from '@expressive-code/core'
import { h } from '@expressive-code/core/hast'

export function reportCodeBlockPlugin() {
  return definePlugin({
    name: 'Report',
    hooks: {
      postprocessRenderedBlock: ({ renderData }) => {
        // Wrap the rendered code block in a new div element.
        renderData.blockAst = h('div', [
          // Add the rendered code block as a child of the new div element.
          renderData.blockAst,
          // Add custom content after the code block.
          h('div', 'Custom content'),
        ])
      },
    },
  })
}
```

The code above would generate the following code block:

import Example from './examples/_create-expressive-code-plugin.astro'

<Example step={1} />

## Add a link to report code blocks

The same approach can be used to add a link to report an incorrect code block.
GitHub provides a way to create a new issue using a URL with some pre-filled information using query parameters such as `title` and `body`.

The body of the issue can be pre-filled with the content of the code block using the [`codeBlock.code`](https://expressive-code.com/reference/core-api/#code) and [`codeBlock.language`](https://expressive-code.com/reference/core-api/#language) properties provided to the `postprocessRenderedBlock` hook.

```js {6-21} {25-26}
export function reportCodeBlockPlugin() {
  return definePlugin({
    name: 'Report',
    hooks: {
      postprocessRenderedBlock: ({ codeBlock, renderData }) => {
        // Create a new URL object with the issue creation URL.
        const url = new URL(`https://github.com/HiDeoo/hideoo.dev/issues/new`)
        // Set the title and body of the issue.
        url.searchParams.set('title', 'Incorrect code block')
        url.searchParams.set(
          'body',
          `The following code block is incorrect:

\`\`\`${codeBlock.language}
${codeBlock.code}
\`\`\`

Additional context:

<!-- Please provide any additional context here. -->`,
        )

        renderData.blockAst = h('div', [
          renderData.blockAst,
          // Create a new div element with a link to the issue creation URL.
          h('div', h('a', { href: url.toString() }, 'Report incorrect code')),
        ])
      },
    },
  })
}
```

The code above would generate the following code block:

<Example step={2} />

## Style the report link

An Expressive Code plugin can also provide custom CSS to style the new elements added to the code block.
To do so, the [`baseStyles`](https://expressive-code.com/reference/plugin-api/#basestyles) property of the plugin configuration object can be used.

```js {4-12} {21-22}
export function reportCodeBlockPlugin() {
  return definePlugin({
    name: 'Report',
    // Add custom CSS to style the new link.
    baseStyles: `
      .actions {
        display: flex;
        font-size: 0.875rem;
        justify-content: flex-end;
        padding-inline: 0.5em;
      }
    `,
    hooks: {
      postprocessRenderedBlock: ({ codeBlock, renderData }) => {
        // URL generation logicâ€¦

        renderData.blockAst = h('div', [
          renderData.blockAst,
          h(
            'div',
            // Add a class to the new element to style its content.
            { class: 'actions' },
            h('a', { href: url.toString() }, 'Report incorrect code'),
          ),
        ])
      },
    },
  })
}
```

The CSS styles will need to be updated to match the design of your website, but the above example will now start to look like this:

<Example step={3} />

The plugin can be further improved by adding more features such as adding a reference to the page containing the code block in the new issue body, using a button to open a modal to report the issue, sending the issue to a different platform, etc.
