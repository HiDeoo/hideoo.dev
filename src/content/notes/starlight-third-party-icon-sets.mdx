[Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) provides a [set of icons](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/components/#all-icons) that you can use out of the box in your documentation website.
The available icons are a limited selection of common icons from the [Unicons set](https://github.com/Iconscout/unicons) which may not be enough for all use cases.

Using third-party icon sets in Starlight is possible and this guide will show you one possible way to do so using [`unplugin-icons`](https://github.com/unplugin/unplugin-icons) which relies on [Iconify](https://iconify.design/) with over 200,000 icons from many open source icon sets.

Other alternatives include [`astro-icon`](https://github.com/natemoo-re/astro-icon) or the [Iconify Icon web component](https://iconify.design/docs/iconify-icon/) [^1].

[^1]: The Iconify Icon web component retrieves [icon data on demand](https://iconify.design/docs/iconify-icon/#icon-data-on-demand) on the client side.

## Prerequisites

You will need to have an existing Starlight website.

## Install `unplugin-icons`

Start by installing the `unplugin-icons` package:

import Pkg from '@components/Pkg.astro'

<Pkg pkg="unplugin-icons @iconify/json" />

:::note
`@iconify/json` is a fairly large package containing all the icon data from Iconify. You can install it once and use any icon set but you can also [install individual icon sets](https://github.com/unplugin/unplugin-icons#install-by-icon-set) if you prefer.
Note that only the icons you use will be included in your final markup.
:::

## Configure `unplugin-icons`

Import the Vite plugin provided by `unplugin-icons` in your `astro.config.mjs` file to add it to the [`vite.plugins`](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/configuration-reference/#vite) array:

```js ins={4,8-10}
// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight'
import Icons from 'unplugin-icons/vite'

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [starlight({ title: 'My Docs' })],
  vite: {
    plugins: [Icons({ compiler: 'astro' })],
  },
})
```

Add the `unplugin-icons` type declarations to your `tsconfig.json` file:

```json ins={4-6}
// tsconfig.json
{
  "extends": "astro/tsconfigs/strict",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["unplugin-icons/types/astro"]
  }
}
```

## Use a custom icon

To use a custom icon, you import it using the `~icons/{set}/{name}` path convention and use it in your MDX documentation pages.
To figure out the set and name of the icon you want to use, you can use the [Iconify icon sets reference page](https://icon-sets.iconify.design) or [Ic√¥nes](https://icones.js.org/) website.

For example, this [star icon](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/ph/shooting-star/) from the Phosphor Icons set can be imported using the `~icons/ph/shooting-star` path:

```mdx {10-12}
---
// src/content/docs/example.mdx
title: My content page
---

## My heading

The content of my Starlight page.

import IconStar from '~icons/ph/shooting-star'

<IconStar color="goldenrod" font-size="3rem" aria-hidden />
```

:::note
Any HTML attributes passed to the imported component will be forwarded to the underlying `<svg>` element.
Using `color="red" font-size="3rem"` will change the color and size of the icon.
:::

:::note[Do I need to add ARIA attributes?]
Adding `aria-hidden` to the icon hides it from screen readers which is great if you're using the icon as a decorative element.
Otherwise, you should add a label to the icon with `aria-label="A shooting star"` for example.
:::

The above example will render the following content:

import Example from './examples/_starlight-third-party-icon-sets.astro'
