Using a [rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype) plugin, you can add links to [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) headings to make it easier to share a link to a specific section of your documentation.

## Prerequisites

You will need to have an existing Starlight website.

## Add the plugin

First, install the `rehype-autolink-headings` plugin and also the `@astrojs/markdown-remark` package:

import Pkg from '@components/Pkg.astro'

<Pkg pkg="rehype-autolink-headings @astrojs/markdown-remark" />

:::note
Astro is responsible for injecting heading IDs but does so after your rehype plugins have run.
For `rehype-autolink-headings` to access these IDs, you must first run the Astro `rehypeHeadingIds` plugin available in the `@astrojs/markdown-remark` package.

To learn more about Astro and heading IDs, check out the [Astro documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#heading-ids-and-plugins).
:::

## Configure the plugin

Import the plugins in your `astro.config.mjs` file to add them to the [`markdown.rehypePlugins`](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/configuration-reference/#markdownrehypeplugins) array:

```js ins={4-5,9-11}
// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight'
import { rehypeHeadingIds } from '@astrojs/markdown-remark'
import rehypeAutolinkHeadings from 'rehype-autolink-headings'

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [starlight({ title: 'My Docs' })],
  markdown: {
    rehypePlugins: [rehypeHeadingIds, rehypeAutolinkHeadings],
  },
})
```

Without any further configuration, a level 2 heading like `## My heading` will be transformed to the following HTML containing a link to the heading:

```html {2-4}
<h2 id="my-heading">
  <a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#my-heading">
    <span class="icon icon-link"></span>
  </a>
  My heading
</h2>
```

The plugin is configurable using various [options](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-autolink-headings?tab=readme-ov-file#options) to customize how the links are inserted, their content, attributes, and more.

## Style the links

The plugin does not add any styling to the links by default so you will need to add some yourself.

The goal of this section is to see how to generate links after the heading text containing the `#` character that will be invisible by default and only visible when the user hovers over the heading (or touches the heading on mobile) like the following example:

import Example from './examples/_starlight-heading-links.astro'

<Example />

Start by editing the plugin configuration in your `astro.config.mjs` file to update its various options and also define a custom CSS file that will contain the styling for the links:

```js {5-8,14-29}
export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    starlight({
      title: 'My Docs',
      customCss: [
        // Load this additional CSS file using its relative path.
        './src/styles/headings.css',
      ],
    }),
  ],
  markdown: {
    rehypePlugins: [
      rehypeHeadingIds,
      [
        rehypeAutolinkHeadings,
        {
          // Inject the link after the heading text.
          behavior: 'append',
          // Remove any content from the link.
          content: [],
          properties: {
            // Add a CSS class to the link.
            class: 'heading-link',
            // Add back the default accessibility attributes.
            ariaHidden: 'true',
            tabIndex: -1,
          },
        },
      ],
    ],
  },
})
```

Add a `headings.css` file in your `src/styles/` directory with the following content:

```css
/* Hide the heading links by default. */
.heading-link {
  opacity: 0;
  padding-inline-start: 0.5rem;
  text-decoration: none;

  &::before {
    content: '#';
  }
}

/* Show the heading links when hovering over the headings in Markdown. */
.sl-markdown-content :is(h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6):hover .heading-link {
  opacity: 1;
}
```

Up to you to customize the plugin options and the CSS to match your needs!
