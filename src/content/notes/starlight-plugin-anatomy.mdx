Starlight plugins offer an easy-to-share and reusable way to customize and extend Starlight, the fully-featured documentation theme built on top of the Astro framework.

## What is a Starlight plugin?

A Starlight plugin in its simplest form is a JavaScript object with a `name` and a `hooks` property.
Plugins are referenced in the [Starlight configuration](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/configuration/) in the [`plugins`](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/configuration/#plugins) option, which is an array of plugin objects.

The [`name`](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/plugins/#name) property of a plugin is a string that uniquely identifies the plugin, while the [`hooks`](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/plugins/#hooks) property is an object that contains functions that Starlight calls to run plugin code at specific times.

The following example shows a minimal Starlight plugin that logs a message when the plugin is loaded:

```ts {9-17}
// astro.config.mjs
import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight'
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    starlight({
      plugins: [
        {
          name: 'starlight-plugin-example',
          hooks: {
            'config:setup'({ logger }) {
              // Log a message when the plugin is loaded.
              logger.info('Starlight Plugin Example has been loaded.')
            },
          },
        },
      ],
      title: 'My Docs',
    }),
  ],
})
```

## Plugin hooks

Multiple hooks are available in Starlight plugins, enabling you to define the plugin's behavior, inject custom translation strings, and more.
Check out the [Starlight plugin reference](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/plugins/) for a complete list of available hooks.

### `config:setup`

The mandatory `config:setup` plugin configuration setup function is called when Starlight is initialized.
This hook is called with many useful parameters to define the plugin's behavior, from [reading and updating the Starlight configuration](/notes/starlight-plugin-read-and-update-starlight-configuration) to [overriding Starlight's default components](/notes/starlight-plugin-override-starlight-component).

### `i18n:setup`

The optional `i18n:setup` plugin internationalization setup function can be used to [inject custom translation strings](/notes/starlight-plugin-use-custom-translation-strings), enabling you to provide localized text for the plugin's features.

## Create a Starlight plugin

As showcased in the previous sections, writing a Starlight plugin is as simple as creating a JavaScript object in the Starlight configuration.
Even though this is a great way to get started with Starlight plugins, you will most likely want to create a dedicated package for the plugin, enabling you to share it with others and reuse it in multiple Starlight projects.

Check out the [“How to create a Starlight plugin”](/notes/starlight-plugin-how-to-create) note for more information on how to create and set up a Starlight plugin package.
