title: Starlight Plugins by Example
description: Personal notes and examples gathered while working on many Starlight plugins.
---

Starlight plugins offer an easy-to-share and reusable way to customize and extend [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/), the fully-featured documentation theme built on top of the Astro framework.

This notebook is a collection of personal notes and examples I have gathered while working on [many Starlight plugins](/projects#starlight).
Checking out [existing plugins](https://starlight.astro.build/resources/plugins/#plugins) is also a great way to learn how to create your own Starlight plugins.

## Prerequisites

These notes and examples assume you have a basic understanding of Starlight, Astro, and TypeScript.
Make sure to check out the [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) and [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/) documentation for more information and references.
